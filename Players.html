    <div style="border: 2px solid #000;">
      <p style="font-family: monospace; color: '#ccc';">A legend as a player and manager, Cruyff helped revolutionize the game, first as a mesmerizing attacker and eventually as one of the leading minds in the history of the game.
        A three-time Ballon ‘dOr winner, Cruyff one the third of those three honors while at Barcelona, which he helped lead to the 1974 La Liga title.
        Cruyff also revolutionized the way the game was played as a coach. He embraced the concept of “total football” and devised coaching methods that influence many of today’s greatest coaches and youth academy programs.</p>

    <p style="font: size 30px; color: '#ccc';">Ronaldinho</p>

    <div style="border: 2px solid #000;">
      <p style="font-family: monospace; color: '#ccc';">Ronaldinho arrived at Barcelona in 2004 when the club was just beginning to rise to its current heights. The prolific Brazilian attacker played a major role in bringing the club back to prominence, paving the way for Lionel Messi and the Barcelona stars we know today. 
        Ronaldinho used his flair and flashiness to score 70 league goals during his five seasons at the Camp Nou. He helped lead Barca to a pair of La Liga titles along with the 2005 UEFA Champions League title. He was one of Barcelona’s first players to transcend the world of soccer as a popular culture icon and he still enjoys a massive popular following today. </p>

    <p style="font: size 30px; color: '#ccc';">Lionel Messi</p>

    <div style="border: 2px solid #000;">
      <p style="font-family: monospace; color: '#ccc';">Regarded by many as the best player in the history of the game, Messi has cemented his status in Barcelona lore by dominating the sport for more than a decade. His deadly left foot, defensive-destroying moves, pin-point passing and uncanny creativity has made him virtually unstoppable for years.
        A six-time Ballon d’Or winner, Messi has helped lead Barcelona to 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League titles, shattering goal-scoring records along the way. He has scored an incredible 474 goals for Barcelona and is still dominating, as he currently leads La Liga in goals and assists while helping Barcelona hold first place in the league.</p>

    <p style="font: size 30px; color: '#ccc';">Xavi</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/72/139472-050-E733BAAF/Xavi-FC-Barcelona-football-match-2009.jpg" class="d-block img-fluid" width="500" height="600">

    <div style="border: 2px solid #000;">
      <p style="font-family: monospace; color: '#ccc';">One of the best midfielders in the history of the game, Xavi played the game like no one before or since, serving as the heartbeat for a Spain side that won two Euros and the 2010 World Cup, while also serving as the midfield engine of Barcelona’s most successful period.
        A product of Barcelona’s La Masia academy, Xavi helped Barcelona win eight La Liga titles, as well as four Champions League titles, and did so by elevating the team’s passing-oriented style to an art form. He and Andres Iniesta formed a legendary tandem for club and country, boasting the kind of passing vision and ability to read the game that remains the standard all future playmakers will be measured by.</p>
